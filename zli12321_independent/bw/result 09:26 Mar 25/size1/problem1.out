no metric specified. plan length assumed.

checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.

ff: search configuration is EHC, if that fails then  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is  plan length

ff: found legal plan as follows

step 

time spent:    0.00 seconds instantiating 4 easy, 0 hard action templates
               0.00 seconds reachability analysis, yielding 5 facts and 4 actions
               0.00 seconds creating final representation with 5 relevant facts, 0 relevant fluents
               0.00 seconds computing LNF
               0.00 seconds building connectivity graph
               0.00 seconds searching, evaluating 1 states, to a max depth of 0
               0.00 seconds total time
