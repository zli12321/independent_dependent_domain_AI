no metric specified. plan length assumed.

checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.

ff: search configuration is EHC, if that fails then  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is  plan length

Cueing down from goal distance:    2 into depth [1][2]
                                   0            

ff: found legal plan as follows

step    0: PICK-UP BLOCK3
        1: STACK BLOCK3 BLOCK1
