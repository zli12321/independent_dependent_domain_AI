no metric specified. plan length assumed.

checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.

ff: search configuration is EHC, if that fails then  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is  plan length

Cueing down from goal distance:    4 into depth [1][2]

ff: found legal plan as follows

step    0: UNSTACK BLOCK2 BLOCK4
        1: PUT-DOWN BLOCK2
        2: PICK-UP BLOCK4
        3: STACK BLOCK4 BLOCK3
