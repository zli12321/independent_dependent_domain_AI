no metric specified. plan length assumed.

checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.

ff: search configuration is EHC, if that fails then  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is  plan length

Cueing down from goal distance:    2 into depth [1]
                                   1            [1]

ff: found legal plan as follows

step    0: TURN_TO SATELLITE2 GROUNDSTATION24 STAR23
